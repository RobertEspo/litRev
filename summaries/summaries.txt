Title: Spanish intonation in contact: The case of Miami Cuban bilinguals
Author: Scott Mark Alvord
Summary: broad focus declaratives (L*+H L+H* L-L%) & absolute interrogatives (L*+H L* H-H% OR L*+H L+H* L-L%). First generation favors fall, second gen favors rise, third gen favors fall (doesn't necessarily reflect a change in progress). Social networks of individual speakers significant factor influencing absolute interrogative pattern.
Subjects:
25 Miami Cubans, 3 gens:
(1) born abroad, AOA > 11
(2) born in USA or AOA > 6
(3) born in US to at least one parent w/ criteria from groups 1 or 2.

Title: Perception of Spanish Declarative Questions and Statements by L2 Spanish Speakers
Author: Izaro {Bedialauneta Txurruka}
Topic: Primary and secondary prosodic cues to interrogation.
Population: L1 English L2 Spanish learners (20; 5 years of experience, no proficiency measures or info about their exposure to dialects) & L1 Spanish (13 Peninsular; 14 Argentinian).
Spanish varieties: Central Peninsular (rise H%), Argentinian (circumflex HL%).
Task: FCT. Listened to stimulus sentence, decided if it was a question or not.
Stimuli: 27 sentences total.
Peninsular: 6 declaratives, 6 interrogatives, 12 "manipulated" sentences.
Argentinian: 3 interrogatives, 6 "manipulated" interrogatives.
Manipulations: Resynthesized.
Peninsular:
Declarative base: (1a) rise (1b) flat
Interrogative base: (1c) falling (1d) baseline
Argentinian:
Interrogative base: (2a) remove peak and maintain baseline (2b) remove peak and falling
Should email Izaro and ask why they decided to use these manipulations and why they decided to use an Argentinian speaker, with HL%, instead of another speak that has no peak in the nuclear configuration if they're interested solely in comparing falling/rising questions. Why did they not include original declaratives from the Argentinian speaker?
Results:
PS sentences: L1 & L2 speakers differed in all sentence types except for unmanipulated declaratives. If the sentence had a final boundary that was flat or falling (1b, 1c, 1d), more likely than L1 speakers to say it's not a question. Even if the boundary tone is high, still less likely than L1 to say it's a question.
AS sentences: L1 & L2 speakers performed differently for all sentence types. AS performed around chance level for manipulated sentence (2a). L2 speakers called the low (2b) a statement, but the baseline a question (2a). So they're not ONLY attending to the boundary tone. The original interrogative was perceived as a question.
Discussion: L2 speakers relied on universal tendencies to interrogation (what about the original AS declarative & 2a?).
Main cue is high tone at the end of utterance, but not necessarily the boundary tone.
Contradicts Trimble (2013), who found L2 Spanish had a lot of trouble with Venezuelan interrogative circumflex. Attributes this to relative height of last accentual peak. What about exposure?

Title: A multilab study of bilingual infants: Exploring the preference for infant-directed speech
Author: Krista Byers-Heinlein and Angeline Sin Mei Tsui and Christina Bergmann and Alexis K Black and Anna Brown and Maria Julia Carbajal and Samantha Durrant and Christopher T Fennell and Anne-Caroline Fiévet and Michael C Frank and {others}
Goals/Questions: (1) Do infants prefer IDS to ADS across languages and cultures? (2) Does bilingualism impact IDS vs ADS interest? (3) How does amount of exposure to NAE IDS affect bilingual infants’ listening preferences? Disentangles dose effects of exposure to NAE IDS from infants’ bilingualism. This final goal/question seems sort of strange to me – I don’t entirely see the motivation.
Participants: 333 bilinguals, 384 monolinguals. Two groups: 6-9 months, 12-15 months. Across 17 labs in seven countries.
Methodology: Labs used either central fixation, eye tracking, or head-turn-preference procedure.
I’ve noticed that a lot of these methodologies has a manual aspect of measuring infants’ looking times (“In the HPP… duration of their looking to the visual stimulus was measured via button press” [p. 5]). That seems a bit messy to me. But I suppose that when dealing with infant looking time, maybe a difference in milliseconds doesn’t matter.
Stimuli: Seminaturalistic speech from mothers describing objects to infant (IDS) or researcher (ADS). Only NAE stimuli. Seems sort of strange to me that all infants were exposed to only NAE.
The statistics in this paper is ridiculously complex and need to review them again.
Discussion:
•	IDS/ADS preferences similar across mono- and bilinguals, as well as in variability of preferences within groups. That is, mono- and bilinguals have similar variability.
•	Bilinguals with greater exposure to NAE showed greater NAE IDS preference. Suggests continuous dose effect of exposure on IDS preference.
•	Age * SES * IDS interaction. Younger children from high SES families preferred IDS, but similar IDS preference at later age group.
Although the actual results of this study are great and interesting, I think a huge contribution of this study is the multilab-nature of it and its rigorous statistics. To me, when I see another large scale study, I will definitely be pulling this one up again.

First, I’m surprised about the low number of target items in studies, with the majority of them having less than 10 target items (p. 16). I’m skeptical that the small number of target items can really get at “true” cross-linguistic influence, as opposed to performance mismatch. I’m thinking of Joseph Casillas’ study “Interlingual interactions elicit performance mismatches not ‘compromise’ categories” (2021). Although his study focuses on EN-ES adult bilingual coronal stop production, I think it’s relevant: with such few target items, how do we know we’re really getting at genuine cross-linguistic influence, as opposed to just performance mismatch? That is, we know that bilinguals constantly activate both of their grammars when producing speech. If they have two or more options available to them, they may just be choosing the “wrong option” for the context due to processing difficulties, task difficulties, or just the strangeness/unnaturalness of a given task.
Something that this paper really honed in on for me was the difference between comparing child bilingual’s “two grammars” to their child monolingual counterparts vs adult monolinguals. Although I do think that comparing a bilingual’s grammar, child or not, to an adult monolingual’s is valid depending on the research question, as we discussed in class, I don’t think that they are fully getting at their research question here. Specifically, the example they give about Persian and English compound noun headedness: if English monolingual children do produce left-headed compounds at times, ungrammatical in adult monolingual English grammars, then I think it’s not intuitive or interesting to compare English-Persian bilingual children to adults. Given that we don’t know the rest of the studies involved and if there’s more cases like this, I’m skeptical about getting the full picture here with their results.
I loved the nuance that we get about language dominance and the societal language: language dominance predicts strength of the cross-linguistic influence, not the presence (p. 23). Something that would be interesting to me is determining if “percentages of dominance” correspond to specific areas of cross-linguistic influence. For example, Spanish-English bilinguals of varying dominance levels (i.e. some fake categories: high EN dom, mid-high EN dom, mid EN dom, “balanced”) have specific areas of their grammar associated with cross-linguistic influence. If, for example, high EN doms have cross-linguistic influence across the board; mid-high EN dom have less cross-linguistic influence in something specific across the majority of the population, like not producing prepositions at the end of a sentence (“¿Quién estás hablando con?”); etc. So we’d be able to make entailment predictions like “If a bilingual does not produce X, then they will not produce Y”.

Title: Teaching and Learning L2 Spanish Intonation: Technology and Classroom Instruction
Author: Angela George
L1 English L2 Spanish (N = 10, seems like intermediate to advanced) intonation production.
Target utterances: 7 absolute interrogatives, 4 neutral broad-focused declaratives, 3 info-seeking pronominal interrogatives (i.e., wh-questions).
Produced before and one week after 30 mins of in-class intonation instruction.
Explicit instruction: Visuals (map & Praat spectrograms) & recordings from Interactive Atlas of Spanish Intonation. Instructor explained differences in intonation contours between 3 types of utterances in 8 macrodialects. That seems like a lot of information to pack into 30 minutes!
Results: Absolute interrogatives and neutral broad-focused declaratives didn't change much in post-test, but wh-questions changed more (40% different from pre-test, at least 1 utterance produced different for all participants).
Discussion: Wh-question intonation isn't variable, so possibly why most effect is seen here. Maybe advanced learners already have intonation "cemented" in their brain, so less likely to change. Overall, explicit instruction has little impact.

Title: L2 intonation perception in learners of Spanish
Author: Angela George
Summary: Explicit instruction on intonation to accurately identify yes-no questions, broad-focused declarative statements, and wh-questions in advanced (L2 and heritage) Spanish learners. Learner gains non-significant.
Participants: 11 3rd and 4th year students enrolled in advanced Spanish courses. 2 heritage speakers.
Pretest: Listen to 21 utterances (7 declaratives, 7 yes-no questions, 7 wh-questions each from 7 regional macrodialects) and identify sentence type and dialect.
Explicit instruction: A few days after pretest, participants received ~20 mins of instruction on utterance type intonation and dialect.
Posttest: Performed same exercise.
Statistics: Correct answer = 1, incorrect = 0. Scores added together. Not normally distributed, so non-parametric Related-Samples Wilcoxon Signed Rank test was used.
Results: Most participants performed at ceiling. Had trouble with Puerto Rican dialect (only Caribbean one with high boundary tone for yes-no questions).

Title: The development of L2 Spanish intonation during a study abroad immersion program in Le{\'o}n, Spain: Global contours and final boundary movements
Author: Nicholas C Henriksen and Kimberly L Geeslin and Erik W Willis
Summary: First technically-principled examination of L2 Spanish intonation developing in study abroad context. Overall F0 contours and final boundary movements. 5 L1 English L2 Spanish in León, Spain (7 weeks abroad). Production elicited for 3 context-based sentence types: declaratives, absolute interrogatives, and pronominal interrogatives. Increase of frequency of their more dominant intonation patterns &/or changes in final boundary tone inventory.
Participants: 5 L1 EN L2 ES. Age: 16 to 18. Proficiency: Not measured. Time learning: 3 to 7 years. Homestay. Signed agreement not to speak English during time in Spain.
Computerized Elicitation Task: Divided into 2 part.
(1) Story involving fictional cartoon family. Contextualized lexical items and sentences. Used to provide meaningful context so they can produce meaningful production.
(2) Participants read target sentences. Elicited declaratives (12), absolute interrogatives (12), & pronominal interrogatives (12). Each target produced 4 times, so 32 total targets per sentence type. 96 targets; 40 distractors.
Labeling system:
IT: Initial tonal level.
kL: Low tone of the first patch accent of wh-word
kH: High tone of the first pitch accent of wh-word
pL: Low tone of the prenuclear pitch accent
pH: High tone of the prenuclear pitch accent
nL: Low tone of the nuclear pitch accent
nH: High tone of the nuclear pitch accent
FT: Final tonal value - final boundary tone
Looking at this labeling system, notice that there's no phrase tones. Also included AM labels, but did not include tonal alignment information (e.g., used LH, not L*+H/L+H*).

Title: Input and language development in bilingually developing children
Author: Erika Hoff and Cynthia Core
•	Oral language skills < 5 years old strong predictors of subsequent academic outcomes (p. 2)
o	Again, scary!
•	“high-quality input is more likely to be provided by adults whose own level of language proficiency is high” (p. 3)
o	How do we measure language proficiency in monolingual adults? Calling it proficiency seems very sketchy, especially if work is being done with minority populations.
•	“some evidence that developing the ability to understand a language does not require as much input as developing the ability to speak a language” (p. 5)
o	It’s surprising to me that there’s only “some” evidence for this. I feel like this is a very common scenario for heritage speakers.
•	“parents are more likely to use the minority language with daughters than with sons and that girls are more likely to develop as bilinguals than boys” (p. 5)
o	Wow! Very strange.
•	“language exposure via television is not particularly supportive” (p. 6)
o	I saw a study investigating this in my language development class in undergrad, and I think it’s a surprising finding due to the amount of folks who grew up in a monolingual environment and supposedly learned English through TV exposure. I’m skeptical of their claims and the “ease” of it, but I’m also skeptical about the outright assertion that TV exposure is not supportive.

# kalashnikova2022input
Title: Input quality and speech perception development in bilingual infants’ first year of life
Author: Marina Kalashnikova and Manuel Carreiras
Goals: (1) Linguistic properties of infant-directed speech (IDS) in monolingual and bilingual environments; (2) how infants use IDS in linguistic development. Specifically investigating quality of input.
Participants: monolingual (Spanish or Basque) & bilingual (Spanish-Basque) infants, 5 months & 9 months. All parents are proficient Spanish-Basque bilinguals.
Infant task: Speech perception task. Descriminate three categories of bilabial consonants with different VOTs. Produced by English speaker, I supposed to get natural aspiration, but is the vowel important?
Mother task: infants’ mothers recorded in interactions with their infants and with an adult. Calculated vocalic triangle area for IDS compared to ADS.
The structure of their LME seems a little odd.
Looking time ~ Trial Type + Age Group + Lang Group
+ Test Order + Trial Type * Age Group
+ Trial Type * Lang Group + Trial Type
* Age Group * Lang Group + (1 | Participant)
This could be simplified to:
Looking time ~ Trial Type * Age Group * Lang Group + Test Order + (1 | Participant).
I wonder why they didn’t include item as a random intercept, or why they didn’t include random slopes?
I’m surprised that for the correlation tests between maternal vowel hyper-scores and infants’ difference scores, they didn’t include correlations separately for monolingual and bilingual populations. Since we are assuming that bilinguals receive less input, it might be the case that exaggerated vowels help them more than monolinguals, who receive more input. I’m also not sure why they wouldn’t put this into a regression model instead of using correlations. In fact, although it would make for a very complicated model, they could have attempted to add it as a predictor in the “Looking time ~” model, no?
Results: 9 month olds who directed less attention to non-native contrast had mothers who had greater degree of exaggerated vowels in IDS.
The background literature on the relationship between mothers’ degree of vowel exaggeration and infants’ current and future vocabulary size and future language proficiency, as late as 4 years old, is terrifying (p. 3).

22 children, aged 42 months to 78 months (i.e., 1;8 to 6;5, huge range). 11 EN mono (m = 52 months), 11 SP-EN bi (m = 61 m). Is that significantly different? No SES measures.
Prosody task: "it looks like a NOUN" (noun-focus or verb-focus), children chose correct pic.
non-linguistic measures: card sort & day and night (executive function tasks).
Results: No sig diff b/w groups, but bi performed slightly better. looks like both groups performed better on NOUN than VERB. EF not sig either.
This would be good to redo with a larger sample size, two bilingual groups, SES control, and smaller age range.

Title: Beyond segments: Towards a L2 intonation learning theory

L2 Intonation Learning theory (LILt).
(i) systemic: inventory and distribution of categorical phonological elements.
(ii) realizational: phonetic implementation of these categorical elements.
(iii) semantic: functionality of the categorical elements or tunes.
(iv) frequency: frequency of use of the categorical elements.
An issue I see is that we're seeing more and more than intonation is not as categorical as we think (e.g., Orrico's study on empathy/exposure).
Explicitly distinguishes between phonological and phonetic elements.

Title: L2 English intonation: Relations between form-meaning associations, access to meaning, and L1 transfer
Author: Marta Ortega-Llebaria and Laura Colantoni
Perception/production of sentential English focus by advanced L2 English (L1 Mandarin = 13, L1 Spanish = 14, 13 controls). L1 Spanish showed transfer in perception of focalized verbs/subjects, bias for focus at end of sentence. Only group to insert pause after focalized word. More obvious in contextualized tasks.
RQ: "We examine whether L1 transfer on L2 form-meaning associations can be modeled by manipulating access to meaning through context" (p. 4). Does access to meaning reduce or increase L1 transfer? Previous research shows that tasks promoting acoustic perception triggered less L1 transfer; tasks involving access to meaning/higher levels of processing increased L1 transfer.
Task: Perception of English contrastive sentence focus in subject, verb, & object position.
2 perception & 2 production.
[+access-to-meaning] ([+AM]): listen to story with illustrations. Production: stimuli = "who is the dog? is bobby the dog?" answer: "no, TOBY is the dog." Perception: Q: Did bobby fall out of the tree? match to one of 3 sentences w/ diff contours eg TOBY fell out of the tree, toby FELL OUT of the tree... Match a contextualized/accessible meaning to appropriate sentence F0 contour.
[-AM]: Presented w/ isolated sentences unrelated in meaning. Production, imitation. Perception, match sentence to low-pass filtered sentences. (sounds like it really works working memory, and why low-pass filtered?)
ENGLISH FOCUS: Prominent word associated w/ pitch accent of expanded pitch range, longer duration, and louder intensity. Words following prominent word are produced w/ compressed pitch range, shorter durations, and softer intensity.
SPANISH FOCUS: Face found evidence for focus receiving pitch accent in ES Madrid, but Toledo didn't find such for Bueno Aires (granted, it was 1989...). Usually syntactic, though.
MANDARIN FOCUS: Expand pitch range & duration of tone in focalized word, compress pitch range in postfocal words. Prefocal words not affected by pitch compression.
So taking these three together: English & Mandarin are similar in using prosody/intonation to mark focus, whereas Spanish more often resorts to word order.
RESULTS: Spanish performed worst. For perception, [+AM] verb position most difficult to perceive; for [-AM], subject position. Spanish performed worse than Mandarin.
Perception: Participants performed better in [-AM] (in production, too). When not focusing on just the acoustic cues, it's harder to process (makes sense).

# trimble2013acquiring
Title: Acquiring variable L2 Spanish intonation in a study abroad context
Author: John C Trimble
Participants: (1) 9 L2 Spanish study abroad in Mérida, Venezuela (1 semester; 14 weeks). Homestays with weekly language exchanges. Intermediate or higher. (2) 4 L1 Venezuelan Spanish.
Tasks: 2 tasks completed before and after traveling to Venezuela (last week of 15 weeks abroad).
(1) Contextualized reading task [formal]: PowerPoint slide: Scripted, ongoing conversation between subject and their friend Juan.
(2) Twenty Questions-like game [informal]: Pairs of participants interacted. One received a notecard with a famous person, place, or thing that the other had to guess by asking yes-no questions. They could ask for hints.
Results:
Notable changes in pitch range (to be wider).
Different declarative patterns were adopted, but interrogative patterns mostly stayed the same (p. 89). Need to look at this more closely, a bit confusing.
Three-way repeated-measured ANOVA with factors of Time (before or after study abroad), Sentence Type (Venezuelan-like declarative or interrogative), and Spanish-to-English ratio (i.e., how much Spanish vs English they spoke in Venezuela; measures taken for first 8 weeks & second 7 weeks). Main effects for Time & Sentence Type. Sig interaction between Time & ES-to-EN ratio.
The inclusion of ES-to-EN ratio & its interaction with Time doesn't really make sense to me since he didn't include a baseline (i.e., at the start of their study abroad). I guess he's looking for Venezuelan-like target utterances, but then maybe he should've included a questionnaire at the beginning for ES-to-EN ratio specifically interacting with Venezuelan speakers? Or doing a completely separate model to include it.
2 x 2 x 2 repeated-measured ANOVA with factors Time, Sentence Type, and Native Speaker Interaction (high vs low). Main effects for Time & SentenceType & interaction between Time & NS Interaction.
Discussion: Close interaction with native speakers (i.e., making close friends) is best predictor for producing target-like intonation (in this case, Venezuelan).
Learners who have achieved a higher level of proficiency before traveling abroad showed relatively less change in their L2 intonation. Lower level learners more open (or more able?) to incorporate new target language features. (They don't PRODUCE the targets, but what about perception?) However, statistical analysis showed no relationship between proficiency at start of program and intonational development.
Note: This thesis includes data from the study "Acquiring dialect-specific yes-no question intonation during study abroad in Venezuela" (2023).

L1 English L2 Spanish production (N = 9, intermediate level or higher) of regionally-indexed (Mérida, Venezuela) intonation during study abroad (one semester; 14 weeks).
Increased frequency of familiar patterns (i.e., falling contours for declaratives), adopted new patterns (i.e., regional circumflex contour for absolute interrogatives). High levels of variation across individuals.

Topic: Primary and secondary prosodic cues to interrogation.
Population: L1 English L2 Spanish learners (20; 5 years of experience, no proficiency measures or info about their exposure to dialects) & L1 Spanish (13 Peninsular; 14 Argentinian).
Spanish varieties: Central Peninsular (rise H%), Argentinian (circumflex HL%).
Task: FCT. Listened to stimulus sentence, decided if it was a question or not.
Stimuli: 27 sentences total.
Peninsular: 6 declaratives, 6 interrogatives, 12 "manipulated" sentences.
Argentinian: 3 interrogatives, 6 "manipulated" interrogatives.
Manipulations: Resynthesized.

Declarative base: (1a) rise (1b) flat
Interrogative base: (1c) falling (1d) baseline
Argentinian:
Interrogative base: (2a) remove peak and maintain baseline (2b) remove peak and falling
Should email Izaro and ask why they decided to use these manipulations and why they decided to use an Argentinian speaker, with HL%, instead of another speak that has no peak in the nuclear configuration if they're interested solely in comparing falling/rising questions. Why did they not include original declaratives from the Argentinian speaker?
Results:
PS sentences: L1 & L2 speakers differed in all sentence types except for unmanipulated declaratives. If the sentence had a final boundary that was flat or falling (1b, 1c, 1d), more likely than L1 speakers to say it's not a question. Even if the boundary tone is high, still less likely than L1 to say it's a question.
AS sentences: L1 & L2 speakers performed differently for all sentence types. AS performed around chance level for manipulated sentence (2a). L2 speakers called the low (2b) a statement, but the baseline a question (2a). So they're not ONLY attending to the boundary tone. The original interrogative was perceived as a question.
Discussion: L2 speakers relied on universal tendencies to interrogation (what about the original AS declarative & 2a?).
Main cue is high tone at the end of utterance, but not necessarily the boundary tone.
Contradicts Trimble (2013), who found L2 Spanish had a lot of trouble with Venezuelan interrogative circumflex. Attributes this to relative height of last accentual peak. What about exposure?

# wells2004intonation
Title: Intonation development from five to thirteen
Author: Bill Wells and Sue Peppé and Nata Goulandris
Summary
Goal: Get better understanding of intonation development across childhood.
Participants: 120 children total, 30 in each group = 5;6, 8;7, 10;10, 13;9 (5;0 to 14;3). L1 is English & English spoken at home, but didn't identify any other languages.
Task aims: Chunking, Affect, Interaction, Focus. Production & Comprehension.
Results: high variability. Intonation production functionality established at 5, specfiic functional contrasts not mastered until 8. Comprehension develops up to 10, correlates w/ measures of expressive/receptive lang development.
Methodology & Task Items
Chunking: prosodic delimitation of utterances into units. In this case, grammatical distinction between compound nouns e.g., chocolate biscuits and honey. Targets intonation phrase & accent groups. Previous research on chunking (e.g., "she dressed(%) & fed the baby%") shows conflicting results in children's abilities, possbily due to task/grammatical complexity.
percetion: voice says 2 or 3 foods (e.g., fruit-salad & milk vs fruit, salad & milk)
production: child sees pic w/ 2 or 3 foods.
Affect: Express strong liking vs reservation. Children identifying emotions from voice have increasing accuracy with age (four, five, six years old; Van der Meulen, Janssen & den Os, 1997). Cruttenden (1985) for reservation: children at 10 did not have adult-like comprehension. However, there was variation among children (those who performed "adult-like") and adults (who performed non-adult-like) -- does this have to do with EMPATHY? Something here to investigate.
perception: like or dislike pic w/ rise-fall or fall-rise on [m].
production: child does the same.
Interaction: Comprehension affirmation or rejection. Intonational Pharse & Accent Group.
perception: child names pic, tester repeats w/ fall on low onset (go on) or rise with high onset (questioning, repeat).
production: voice says non-word or real word. child repeats word with questioning (nonword) or affirming (real world). this one seems particularly complicated for children.
Focus: Corrective narrow focus.
perception: i wanted CHOCOLATE and honey vs chocolate and HONEY. child decides which speaker didn't receive.
production: tester offers child a pic saying "how about a green bike?" child responds to get the pic he really needs e.g., "i want a WHITE bike".
Results
Ceiling effects in all tasks, but increasing accuracy with age. There were always some outliers (EMPATHY?). Still a lot of variability, and production less consistently accurate than comprehension.
5 year olds performed below 75% on Comprehension Interaction & Focus, but above 75% for Input Chunking and Affect.
Three older groups above 75% for Comprehension, except Comprehension Focus. Only 13 year olds got >75% for Comp Focus.
For production, all age groups got >75% for chunking/focus, but 5 year olds <75% on affect/interaction.
Positive correlations w/ comprehension/production & CELF/TROG (expressive/receptive language skills assessments).
There are some qualitative analyses on the errors.

Title: Acquisition of Prosodic Focus Marking by Three-to Six-Year-Old Children Learning Mandarin Chinese.
Author: Qianyutong Zhang and Kexin Lyu and Zening Chen and Ping Tang
Summary: 20 3-4 yo, 23 5-6 yo, 22 adult controls. Visual world paradigm. "Find the red cat. Now find the PURPLE/purple cat. (second adj produced w/ or w/o prosodic focus.) 5-6 yos and adults faster fixation towards target w/ prosodic focus; not 3-4 yos. By 5-6 yos, Mandarin-learning children acquired pragmatic meaning of prosodic focus. Maybe the younger kids have not yet developed the necessary executive control to maintain/compare info across utterances? not able to map prosodic focus to pragmatic implicature?

Title: Production of Contrastive Focus in Mandarin-Speaking Children
Author: Sichen Zhang and Aijun Li and Jun Gao
Summary: Contrastive focus in Mandarin children (4;7 to 6;0, 10 participants). Adj1 + Noun1 + Verb + Adj2 + Noun2 structure. Most common misplacements: noun2 > adj1 > adj2. Acoustic cues: pitch range expansion, durational adjustment, post-focus compression. Developed gradually with age. Still developing at age 6 due to complex interaction of lexical/phrase prosody.
Acoustic analysis:
Lowering of post-focus pitch register, lowering varies according to setence position.
Duration: Of two units (e.g., N1 vs N2, Adj1 vs Adj2), the focused element was longer, but not the longest of the utterance.
