L1 English L2 Spanish production (N = 9, intermediate level or higher) of regionally-indexed (MÃ©rida, Venezuela) intonation during study abroad (one semester; 14 weeks).
Increased frequency of familiar patterns (i.e., falling contours for declaratives), adopted new patterns (i.e., regional circumflex contour for absolute interrogatives). High levels of variation across individuals.
Two tasks before and after traveling to Venezuela:
(1) Contextualized reading task (formal): PowerPoint slide: Scripted, ongoing conversation between subject and their friend Juan.
(2) [Formal task]: Don't have access to read it :-(
Results: Repeated measures ANOVA with Task (formal vs informal) & Pattern for interrogative (rise vs circumflex). Sig main effects and interaction. 3 participants produced circumflex more often for informal; one participant produced them roughly equally in both tasks.
