Summary
Does bilingualism conferm advantage to children's conversation understanding? 163 children aged 3-6 years. Administered Conversational Violations Test, identify responses to questions as violations of Gricean maxims. Italian/Slovenian (dom Slovenian) outperformed Italian & Slovenian monolinguals. They seem to be sequential bilinguals: learned Slovenian from birth, exposed to Italian at school.
I wish they had another bilingual control group.
No executive function effects, but everyone performed around ceiling.
