L2 Intonation Learning theory (LILt).
(i) systemic: inventory and distribution of categorical phonological elements.
(ii) realizational: phonetic implementation of these categorical elements.
(iii) semantic: functionality of the categorical elements or tunes.
(iv) frequency: frequency of use of the categorical elements.
An issue I see is that we're seeing more and more than intonation is not as categorical as we think (e.g., Orrico's study on empathy/exposure).
Explicitly distinguishes between phonological and phonetic elements.
