22 children, aged 42 months to 78 months (i.e., 1;8 to 6;5, huge range). 11 EN mono (m = 52 months), 11 SP-EN bi (m = 61 m). Is that significantly different? No SES measures.
Prosody task: "it looks like a NOUN" (noun-focus or verb-focus), children chose correct pic.
non-linguistic measures: card sort & day and night (executive function tasks).
Results: No sig diff b/w groups, but bi performed slightly better. looks like both groups performed better on NOUN than VERB. EF not sig either.
This would be good to redo with a larger sample size, two bilingual groups, SES control, and smaller age range.
