Summary: First technically-principled examination of L2 Spanish intonation developing in study abroad context. Overall F0 contours and final boundary movements. 5 L1 English L2 Spanish in Le√≥n, Spain (7 weeks abroad). Production elicited for 3 context-based sentence types: declaratives, absolute interrogatives, and pronominal interrogatives. Increase of frequency of their more dominant intonation patterns &/or changes in final boundary tone inventory.
Participants: 5 L1 EN L2 ES. Age: 16 to 18. Proficiency: Not measured. Time learning: 3 to 7 years. Homestay. Signed agreement not to speak English during time in Spain.
Computerized Elicitation Task: Divided into 2 part.
(1) Story involving fictional cartoon family. Contextualized lexical items and sentences. Used to provide meaningful context so they can produce meaningful production.
(2) Participants read target sentences. Elicited declaratives (12), absolute interrogatives (12), & pronominal interrogatives (12). Each target produced 4 times, so 32 total targets per sentence type. 96 targets; 40 distractors.
Labeling system:
IT: Initial tonal level.
kL: Low tone of the first patch accent of wh-word
kH: High tone of the first pitch accent of wh-word
pL: Low tone of the prenuclear pitch accent
pH: High tone of the prenuclear pitch accent
nL: Low tone of the nuclear pitch accent
nH: High tone of the nuclear pitch accent
FT: Final tonal value - final boundary tone
Looking at this labeling system, notice that there's no phrase tones. Also included AM labels, but did not include tonal alignment information (e.g., used LH, not L*+H/L+H*).
