•	Oral language skills < 5 years old strong predictors of subsequent academic outcomes (p. 2)
o	Again, scary!
•	“high-quality input is more likely to be provided by adults whose own level of language proficiency is high” (p. 3)
o	How do we measure language proficiency in monolingual adults? Calling it proficiency seems very sketchy, especially if work is being done with minority populations.
•	“some evidence that developing the ability to understand a language does not require as much input as developing the ability to speak a language” (p. 5)
o	It’s surprising to me that there’s only “some” evidence for this. I feel like this is a very common scenario for heritage speakers.
•	“parents are more likely to use the minority language with daughters than with sons and that girls are more likely to develop as bilinguals than boys” (p. 5)
o	Wow! Very strange.
•	“language exposure via television is not particularly supportive” (p. 6)
o	I saw a study investigating this in my language development class in undergrad, and I think it’s a surprising finding due to the amount of folks who grew up in a monolingual environment and supposedly learned English through TV exposure. I’m skeptical of their claims and the “ease” of it, but I’m also skeptical about the outright assertion that TV exposure is not supportive.
